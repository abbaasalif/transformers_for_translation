To get the training data please download from https://www.statmt.org/europarl/v7/fr-en.tgz. Unzip this folder and place in your google drive in an appropriate folders.

I reffered to many links to create this code and the hyperparameters in this are not from the original "attention is all you need paper" as it takes a longer time to train a bigger network.

The other non-breaking words I will upload them you can place it in your folders appropriately - these are words like a.m p.m i.e., which we process seperatley as the code when it encounters a "full stop" process them as lines so to avoid that processing 
and give a small boost to the model. (However does not help much it is good to have)
